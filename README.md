# Parallel

## Parallelization

This project utilizes parallelization techniques to enhance performance and efficiency. Parallelization involves breaking down a task into smaller parts that can be executed simultaneously, leveraging the capabilities of multi-core processors.

## OpenMP

[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) (Open Multi-Processing) is an API (Application Programming Interface) for parallel programming in shared-memory systems. It provides a set of compiler directives and library routines for parallelizing code and is widely used for exploiting multi-core processors.

### Why OpenMP?

- Simple and Portable: OpenMP is easy to use and is supported by many compilers, making it portable across different platforms.
- Productivity: It allows developers to incrementally parallelize code without significant restructuring.
- Flexibility: OpenMP supports both task parallelism and data parallelism.
